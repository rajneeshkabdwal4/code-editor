# **Realtime Collaborative Code Editor**  

A **Realtime Collaborative Code Editor** built with **Express**, **Socket.IO**, and **React**. Multiple users can join a room, write code together, and see changes in **real-time**. The code can be executed, and the output is displayed to all users in the room.  

## **Features**  
âœ… Real-time collaborative coding with multiple users  
âœ… Code execution with shared output  
âœ… Language selection for different programming languages  
âœ… Room-based collaboration with unique session IDs  
âœ… Seamless UI with a modern frontend
